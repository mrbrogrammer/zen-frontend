💻 Get started with Gatsby locally in 5 Minutes
You can get a new Gatsby site up and running on your local dev environment in 5 minutes with these four steps:

Initialize a new project.

npm init gatsby
Give it the name "My Gatsby Site".

Start the site in develop mode.

Next, move into your new site’s directory and start it up:

cd my-gatsby-site/
npm run develop
Open the source code and start editing!

Your site is now running at http://localhost:8000. Open the my-gatsby-site directory in your code editor of choice and edit src/pages/index.js. Save your changes, and the browser will update in real time!

At this point, you’ve got a fully functional Gatsby website. For additional information on how you can customize your Gatsby site, see our plugins and the official tutorial.

🎓 Learning Gatsby
Full documentation for Gatsby lives on the website.

For most developers, we recommend starting with our in-depth tutorial for creating a site with Gatsby. It starts with zero assumptions about your level of ability and walks through every step of the process.

To dive straight into code samples head to our documentation. In particular, check out the “How-to Guides”, “Reference”, and “Conceptual Guides” sections in the sidebar.

We welcome suggestions for improving our docs. See the “how to contribute” documentation for more details.
